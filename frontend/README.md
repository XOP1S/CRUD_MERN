# BASIC CRUD

This is a sample project that demonstrates the usage of React Router Dom v6.11.2, React, Tailwind CSS, json-server, and Vite. It showcases the implementation of client-side routing using React Router Dom, building user interfaces with React components, styling with Tailwind CSS, simulating a backend API using json-server, and utilizing Vite as the development server.

The project features a client management system where users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on client data. It includes functionality to add new clients, view client details, edit client information, and delete clients. The data is persisted using json-server, which serves as a mock API.

The technologies used in this project include:

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router Dom: A routing library for React applications, used to handle client-side navigation.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with pre-built styles and classes.
- json-server: A simple backend server that provides a RESTful API for handling data.
- Vite: A fast development server and build tooling for modern web applications.

The project demonstrates how to define routes, create components, handle form submissions, and handle navigation between different pages. It also showcases the integration of Tailwind CSS for styling the user interface and using json-server to simulate a backend API for managing client data. Vite is used as the development server for fast and efficient development.
